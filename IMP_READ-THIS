# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Discord Settings for `/cmd` to Work Properly

If you're using **Type2Talk v2** and want to use the `/cmd` command to play music so that **others can hear it clearly**, you **must disable Noise Suppression** in Discord's voice settings.

---

## 🔧 Required Setting:

### ✅ Disable Noise Suppression
- Go to **Discord > Settings > Voice & Video**
- Scroll down and **NONE** the option labeled:
  > **Noise Suppression**

This is essential. If you leave it enabled, Discord will suppress the music and other users will **not hear it properly**.

---

## 🎚️ Optional Setting (Recommended for Better Audio):

### ❓ Disable "Automatically Determine Input Sensitivity"
- Turn OFF the setting:
  > **Automatically determine input sensitivity**
- Set the manual slider to **-70 dB**

This step is optional, but recommended for **clearer and more consistent audio output**. You can adjust it based on your preference or system performance.

---

🚨 If you don't turn off **Noise Suppression**, music will still play — but others on the call may hear it **muffled or not at all** due to Discord's audio filtering.
