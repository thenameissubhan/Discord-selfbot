Type2Talk - Selfbot TTS for Discord
-------------------------------------

üîä Description:
Type2Talk is a background selfbot that reads your own Discord messages aloud using realistic AI text-to-speech (TTS). It sends the voice to your mic using VB-CABLE, so others on a call can hear it as if you're speaking.

Type2Talk v2 has the same features as the older version, but one thing has been added in v2: the /cmd function. This means you can play a song using /cmd in any server you want, and the audio will pass through both the Discord input channel and your local speaker.
Use /cmd list to learn how the command works and its functions.
